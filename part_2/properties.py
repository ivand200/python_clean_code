"""Properties"""
# For example, if you have an object that needs to return a value in a particular format,
# or data type, a property can be used to do this computation. In the previous example,
# if we decided that we wanted to return the coordinates with a precision of up to four
# decimal places (regardless of how many decimal places the original number was
# provided with), we can make the computation for rounding this in the @property
# method that reads the value.

# You might find that properties are a good way to achieve command and query
# separation ( CC08 ). The command and query separation principle states that a method
# of an object should either answer to something or do something, but not both. If a
# method is doing something, and at the same time it returns a status answering a
# question of how that operation went, then it's doing more than one thing, clearly
# violating the principle that says that functions should do one thing, and one thing
# only.

# Another piece of good advice derived from this example is as followsâ€”don't do
# more than one thing in a method. If you want to assign something and then check
# the value, break that down into two or more statements.

# Methods should do one thing only. If you have to run an action
# and then check for the status, do that in separate methods that are
# called by different statements.

# To illustrate what this means, using the previous example, we would have one
# setter or getter method, to set the email of the user, and then another property to
# simply ask for the email.
